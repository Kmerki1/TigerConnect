    <hr>
	We promise to keep your sensitive information safe and secure with our patented "We Don't Care" method! I didn't have time to program any actual logic behind these settings, so for all intents and purposes, we didn't care enough to actually record it!
    <h2 class="sub-header">Username</h2>
    <hr> 
	Adjust your username in the event you forgot, or just to fit how you feel.<br>
	>Insert username and confirmation text boxes.
    <h2 class="sub-header">Password</h2>
    <hr> 
	This is the password to your whole account! By default, this should be your password to your school account. Make sure it's both complex and memorable, and remember to keep it secret, keep it safe!<br>
	>Insert old password, new password and confirm password text boxes and reset password page link.
	<h2 class="sub-header">Email</h2>
    <hr> 
	By default, your school email is your main email, but if you want multiple recovery emails, adjust it here.<br>
	>Insert large text box for listing emails by line, or develop a way to change elements of a list on the fly.
	<h2 class="sub-header">Phone Number</h2>
    <hr>

	>Insert date dropdowns. Optionally add age calculation.
	<h2 class="sub-header">Blacklist</h2>
    <hr> 
	It's important to report harassing and offensive behavior, but if you'd like to filter others out yourself, you can block them from seeing or messaging you.<br>
	>Insert large text box or way to change lists on the fly.<br><br>
